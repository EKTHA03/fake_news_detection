This project implements a machine learning–based Fake News Detection system that classifies news articles as Real or Fake based on their textual content. The model uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze patterns in language, tone, and structure commonly found in news articles. The dataset used contains labeled news articles and is processed to extract meaningful textual features for classification.

📘 Project Overview

The model: Cleans and preprocesses text data (removes stop words, punctuation, and performs tokenization) Converts text into numerical features using vectorization techniques (TF-IDF / Bag of Words) Trains a machine learning classification model Predicts whether a given news article is real or fake Evaluates model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score (Optional) Generates basic visualizations for model evaluation
